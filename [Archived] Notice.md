**17-Dec-2023:**

TeamNewPipe stops supporting NewPipe Legacy, therefore the Installation script has been updated with standard NewPipe. In case you want to reinstall NewPipe only, use [this Reinstaller to Uninstall and Reinstall to NewPipe version 0.25.2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/112xlbLuzMN0xytWAPEN6jmsa0y-YkRfQ/view?usp=sharing). <br><br>

**15-Apr-2023:**

If you updated to ATLAS version 617 / 618 from 2-Mar-2023 onwards and really wanted to install apps in IHU, you can [flash ATLAS version 617v1 / 618v1 with following guide](https://github.com/xeon1989/Proton-X50-IHU-Upgrade-Downgrade/blob/main/README.md). <br><br>

**13-Apr-2023:**

If you want to avoid applying changes on IHU, you may use this [Modded QDLink](https://github.com/xeon1989/QDLink-Unlocked) for less restricted experience. <br><br>

**7-Apr-2023:**

Youtube seems having issue, so I replaced it with NewPipe.

Additionally added Youtube Vanced Music, feel free to feedback in case of issues.

**6-Mar-2023:**

ACO patched it in latest Firmware version. 

If you updated to ATLAS version 617 / 618 from 2-Mar-2023 onwards, most probably this won't works for you.

There are no way to install app at the moment.
